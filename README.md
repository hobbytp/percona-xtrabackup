These are the patched sources for the metacloud release of xtrabackup. It's all 2.1.1 release code plus a 2.1.3 version of innobackupex. It contains a patch from an unreleased 2.1.3 that fixes hangs on sst. We are also checking it in because the build pulls in all of the mysql 5.1/5.5/5.6 source trees and the pxc 5.1/5.5 source trees.
